The United Kingdom is a nation located

in the British Isles made up of England

Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland



thousands of years ago the Isles were

inhabited by long-forgotten pre-celtic

people known as the beaker culture named

for their distinctive pottery beakers

little is known of them but it has been

suggested that these people laid the

foundations for the mysterious

stonehenge a series of heavy standing

stones which were transported from 150

miles away and arranged to form a

calendar marking the days of the summer

and winter solstice over time waves of

Celtic speaking people arrived from the

European continent who soon came to form

the brittonic Gaelic and Pictish people

these people were not a unified people

but were rather many tribes who shared a

similar pagan religion language and

culture the Romans invaded conquering

what's now England and Wales but failed

to conquer the Pictish tribes to the

north the Romans launched several

campaigns into this land they called

Caledonia however their fortifications

were soon overrun and abandoned and they

retreated to Hadrian's Wall their

conquered lands were incorporated into

the Roman Empire becoming the province

of Britannia

they brought Roman customs and laws

improved infrastructure and connected

many towns and cities with Roman roads

when the Romans left there was a great

migration of Germanic tribes these were

the Jutes Angles and Saxons with their

language Old English their settlement

pushed many Britons to areas in Wales

Brittany and a kingdom known as Domino

Nia while Scotland eventually evolved

into four kingdoms thus most of these

were the Scots who were originally from

Ireland the Britons of Strathclyde the

anglo-saxon kingdom of Benicia and the

pics of Alba

for unknown reasons the Jutes

disappeared from history but the Angles

and Saxons eventually formed Seven

Kingdoms Wessex Sussex Kent Essex East

Anglia Murcia and Benicia became

Northumbria after the collapse of Domino

Nia the remaining territory of Cornwall

fought against the powerful kingdom of

Wessex corn will eventually fall under

the control of Wessex but it managed to

keep its own culture Wales at this point

was also made up of several separate

kingdoms the largest being Gwynedd in

the North poets in the East and differed

to the south the British Isles soon saw

numerous Norse raiders from Scandinavia

these were the Vikings and they began

settlement on many of the Scottish Isles

the Isle of Man and they even founded

the city of Dublin in Ireland the Scots

in the pics then decided to unite under

Kenneth MacAlpine to form the Kingdom of

Alba the kingdom of albergue grew strong

over the years and eventually

Strathclyde was bought into the fault

meanwhile Danish Vikings arrived in the

Anglo Saxon kingdoms for conquest after

fighting the king of Wessex Alfred the

Great the Danelaw was formed a land

where the laws of the Danes held

influence over the anglo-saxons

controlling the region and its affairs

the anglo-saxons eventually defeated the

last Viking king of York Erich blood

acts and Athelstan became the first king

of the English although the newly formed

Kingdom of Denmark would conquer England

and even found a short-lived Danish

dynasty under Knut the Norseman had a

dramatic impact on the Isles so it's no

wonder some words in the English

language have Norse origin after

defeating formidable sea Raiders from

Ireland the Western Isles Scandinavia

and anglo-saxon forces from Murcia were

fed up Llewellyn's subdued his rivals in

southwest Wales Llewellyn became the

only Welsh King ever to rule over the

entire territory of Wales he was

defeated by the English Earl Harold

Godwinson and killed by his own men

leading to the Welsh kingdoms splitting

apart once more at the death of Edward

the Confessor there was a succession

dispute between four claimants Harold

Godwinson was elected as king and

managed to defend England from an

invasion by the Norwegian King Harald

Hardrada however Howard had semaj his

army south to defend against yook

William of Normandy who could cross the

English Channel according to tradition

at the Battle of Hastings Harald was

killed by an arrow to the eye and the

Norman invaders were victorious the new

King William defeated a number of

rebellions built a new design of castles

called moats and Bailey's and introduced

a number of reforms like trial by combat

and the Domesday book the Norman dynasty

invaded into South Wales and parts of

Ireland creating the lordship of Ireland

at court Nobles spoken conducted

sessions in the anglo-norman language

which endured for centuries and left an

incredible mark in development of modern

English

after a brief Civil War henry ii would

marry Eleanor of Aquitaine establishing

the Angevin Empire beginning a long

rivalry against France Richard the

Lionheart defended much of this

territory and also became a central

Christian commander during the Third

Crusade achieving considerable victories

against his Muslim counterparts Saladin

under king john heavy taxes were imposed

on his barons in order to pay for his

expensive Foreign Wars the Baron's

rebelled and forced John to sign the

Magna Carta a charter that established

the principle that everyone was subject

to the law even the king guaranteeing

the rights of individuals the right to

justice and the right to a fair trial

most of North Wales remained

independently ruled by several Welsh

princes until twelve sixteen when

Llewellyn the Great became the ruler of

the Principality of Wales this would be

the case until it but the first who

conquered Wales in 1284 effectively

becoming parts England

at the death of King Alexander the third

Scotland was left with 14 rivals for

succession to prevent civil war the

Scottish magnates asked Edward the first

of England to elect a claimant John

Balliol was elected King but was

constantly undermined by Edward who

opposed Scottish independence Edward

decided to launch several campaigns to

conquer Scotland and depose King John to

which he acquired the nickname hammer of

the Scots under a brave Scottish Knight

William Wallace the Scots mounted

resistance against the English defeating

them at the Battle of Stirling Bridge

Edward marched north in person and

defeated Wallace in battle but Wallace

managed to escape he was later captured

and executed but his efforts allowed

Robert the Bruce to rise up and defeat

the English securing Scottish

independence when the King of France

died without an heir Edward the third

was technically eligible to the crown

through his mother the French Court

denied his claim and instead installed

Philip of Valois Edward paid homage to

Philip as he owned the lands of Gascony

and was essentially a vassal to the King

of France

due to disagreements Edward reasserted

his claim to the throne and invaded

France beginning the Hundred Years War

the English achieved notable victories

at the Battle of Crecy booty air and

Agincourt thanks to the technical

superiority of the longbow but was

unable to conquer the French with the

appearance of Joan of Arc who lifted the

French spirit and turned the tide of the

war upon the death of Edward the third

an entire generation was skipped in the

line of succession which prompted bitter

rivalry between several claimants most

notably were the houses of York and

Lancaster tensions were high until a

bloody age of warfare rubbed it between

these two factions in the Wars of the

Roses it's so in-depth and complicated

this period would likely become a video

of its own the wars ended with the

arrival of the Tudor dynasty Henry the

eighth wanting a divorce split with the

church creating his own Church of

England this ultimately led to a series

of religious differences between future

English monarchs in between his six

wives and naval adventures Henry gave

Wales representation in Parliament and

created the kingdom of Ireland but

realistically he only

trolled an area known as the pale in

addition Henry's paranoia and suspicion

amounted to tens of thousands of

executions including his friends and

wives during the 16th century the

largest of most powerful Empire was

Spain under king philip ii england under

Elizabeth the first were helping Dutch

rebels reject Spanish rule and many

English privateers were also

intercepting Spanish silver on its

journey back from the new world this

angered the spanish king and the final

straw came when Elizabeth had Mary Queen

of Scots executed because she did not

want Scotland falling under Catholicism

the Spanish Armada consisting of 130

ships was deployed to invade England at

the Battle of Gravelines and English

victory forced the Spanish fleet to sail

around the British Isles before storms

in the north of Scotland destroyed the

remaining ships in metallian the english

led by Sir Francis Drake amassed their

own Armada to invade Spain but this too

became a failed endeavor born in this

period William Shakespeare became a

renowned poet playwright and actor who

contributed significantly to English

literature when Queen Elizabeth of

England died without an heir her closest

male relative was James the sixth of

Scotland

James was elected as King of England and

Scotland in a personal Union

although the country's remain separate

political entities as the first monarch

to rule the entire island of Great

Britain several assassination attempts

were made by Catholic conspirators one

such assassination attempt was the

Gunpowder Plot by Guy Fawkes who tried

to blow at Parliament's after a failed

colony known as Roanoke England

established a successful colony known as

Jamestown which would eventually evolved

into the 13 colonies at first

expeditions to the new world were mainly

driven by religious motives which were

predominantly to convert the natives to

their faith but colonies became more

profitable as demand for new world crops

like tobacco and sugar increased British

ships also made a monopoly on the

transportation of captive African slaves

that crossed the Atlantic to the

Americas millions of Africans were

shipped in cramped horrific conditions

to work on brutal plantation

in the Americas and essentially became

property to their masters for 300 years

this practice continued in the British

Empire until it was fully abolished in

1833 this period also saw a wave of

plantations in Ireland where Irish lands

were confiscated and given to English

and Scottish settlers tensions would

rise between Charles the first and

Parliament following disagreements

conflicts between Royal and

parliamentary authority within England

led to the English Civil War the country

became divided between parliamentarians

known as the Roundheads and Royalists

known as the Cavaliers under Oliver

Cromwell and the New Model Army the

parliamentarians defeated Charles and

executed him for treason cromwell became

Lord Protector and dissolved the

monarchy but shortly after his death it

was restored under charles ii charles ii

married Catherine of Braganza and when

she arrived from Portugal she introduced

the greatest beverage of all the time t

T had been used by China for centuries

but its arrival in the 17th century

captured the interest of the English

aristocracy and soon captivated every

other Englishman in 1685 a catholic

james ii became king in a largely

Protestant nation James's daughter Mary

and her Dutch husband William would both

Protestant and many Nobles unhappy with

the Catholic King invited William to

become King William found considerable

support when he invaded and he was soon

crowned King William the third in what

became known as the Glorious Revolution

although Williams supporters dominated

the government there remained a

significant following for James ii in

the scottish highlands clan MacDonald of

Glencoe was one such group who had not

been prompt in pledging allegiance to

the new monarch for this reason alone 38

members of the clan were murdered in

what became known as the massacre of

Glencoe after Scotland's failed colonial

endeavours in Nova Scotia and Panama and

an economic crisis in the 1690s there

was a union between England and Scotland

forming the United Kingdom of Great

Britain the House of Stuart's had ruled

Britain for just over a century but

ended with the death of Queen Anne

Sophia of Hanover

the granddaughter of James the first and

her son George became King Great Britain

soon found itself drawn into several

European Wars most notable being the war

of the Spanish Succession and the Seven

Years War victories in these Wars

resulted in territory for the Empire

particularly in North America although

it resulted in considerable debts in

order to make up for this debt King

George the third ordered heavy taxes be

placed on the thirteen colonies this

among other reasons culminated into the

American War of Independence and with

financial help from France and Spain

the Americans were victorious the East

India Company which was founded by

Elizabeth the first had grown rapidly

and even operated its own military and

controlled a sizable amount of territory

the company had set up fortified

warehouses where they traded with many

India rulers

acquiring important luxuries like

textiles and spices one of the most

important cities of all was Bengal as it

had a large taxable population the

governor of Bengal robert clive ordered

that the population grow opium to export

to China instead of growing food as it

proved to be a great source of income

however when a famine struck it resulted

in the deaths of millions of people

meanwhile Captain James Cook arrived at

New Zealand and the southeast coast of

Australia although he wasn't the first

to discover the area because of past

Portuguese and Dutch explorers however

unlike the Dutch of Portuguese Britain

claimed as their new penal colony known

as New South Wales with the first

convicts arriving in 1778 a new threats

had emerged from France French Emperor

Napoleon Bonaparte



Napoleon had come to dominate most of

Europe but Britain's advantage was that

she was an island and the Royal Navy had

become a major force at sea invasion of

Britain was near impossible and in a

series of coalition's Napoleon was

defeated by the end of the Napoleonic

Wars Britain was growing rapidly into a

superpower based on their supremacy of

naval engineering furthermore in Ireland

the great famine struck a disease

killing potato plants Ireland which had

merged with Britain relied heavily on

this crop for food but the British

government forced Ireland to export what

little food they had to other areas

without any aid or food Ireland's

population plummeted by half due to

starvation and emigration to countries

like the United States things weren't

looking so great in India either as

India was rebelling against company rule

the East India Company had employed many

Indian soldiers known as Sir poised who

were under the command of British

soldiers these sepoys grew increasingly

unhappy and a revolt soon occurred yet

it quickly failed due to a lack of unity

between Indians after the rebellion the

British government took direct control

with Queen Victoria being declared

Empress of India during the 19th century

the world was forever changed by the

Industrial Revolution society was

transformed by technological advances

and increasing mechanization and would

launch Britain to global dominance some

of the greatest innovations and

inventions were the sewing machine the

fire extinguisher steam powered engines

and turbines the electric motor and

photography The Telegraph was also a

major invention as a message could now

be sent from Britain to India in a

matter of hours the establishment of

railways and trains also transformed

transport forever instead of travelling

days by horse and carriage it now only

took a matter of hours by train

engineering and communication advance is

not only United the Empire they

triggered a manufacturing boom like no

other people flocked from rural areas to

city centres for jobs

productivity reached an all-time high

but the consequences of mass migration

resulted in extremely cramped and

polluted

cities however with these problems that

were generated it resulted in an

improved sewage system

Newcastle focused on shipbuilding

Manchester the cotton industry Liverpool

became a major trading centre

Middlesbrough fixated itself on iron and

steel works the presence of iron ore

limestone and large coal deposits in the

West Midlands and southeast Wales

prompted the establishment of ironworks

and Scotland boomed in the linen

industry the Victorian era also saw a

major change in society as families from

the poorest backgrounds gained access to

education although it was much stricter

than today's standards the 1860s also

saw the rise of the greatest food

combination ever fish and chips towards

the end of the 19th century European

powers came together at the Berlin

conference to divide Africa between them

a group in South Africa known as the

Boers who originally Dutch settlers

proved difficult for the British the

Boers lived in two nations the free

orange states and the Republic of

Transvaal and both resisted British rule

using guerilla warfare to counter this

the British placed many women and

children in their tens of thousands into

concentration camps when many died from

starvation and disease Britain became a

major player in the First World War and

many men proudly volunteered to serve

and protect their country the Great War

as it was called saw the use of new

technology such as dreadnoughts

warplanes artillery machine guns

grenades chemical weapons

bolt-action rifles and the first use of

the tank many faced horrific conditions

in the trenches and witness groups of

battles millions died and many returned

home shell shocked by what they had seen

the Empire reached its territorial

heights in 1921 after gaining territory

from Germany and the crumbling Ottoman

Empire the Empire now ruled over 400

million people and controlled one

quarter of the world's land mass but the

reality was Britain could no longer

afford to build bases or ships to defend

its empire as it had before

19:14 Ireland finally managed to break

away from British rule and formed the

Irish free states and shortly after

became a republic the Second World War

was more brutal and horrific than the

first most of Europe had fallen under

German occupation and under Prime

Minister Winston Churchill Britain stood

strong during the Battle of Britain and

the Blitz Britain were extremely

successful at intercepting and decoding

enemy communications with the likes of

Alan Turing who cracked the German

Enigma code the war ended with an allied

victory but many nations within the

Empire felt a desire for independence

and it was clear the Empire was about to

break India was one such nation who were

ready to declare their independence

Mohandas Gandhi practiced a nonviolent

approach and this proved successful are

shortly after India gained independence

the Commonwealth of Nations was formed

to improve relations and economic ties

with former colonies this still remains

today with 53 members united by language

history culture and shared values of

democracy the British Empire officially

ended with Hong Kong Britain's last

colony being handed over to China in

1997 the Empire committed many

atrocities on many different people

imposing their culture and civilization

while often wiping out native ones on

the other hand this brought about

globalization and the uniting of the

modern world and without such

innovations and industrialization the

world might have been a very different

place the United Kingdom suffered a

small economic recession in 2008 but has

since recovered it is a multicultural

society with each region retaining a

presence of its history and culture if

you ever visit look out for the Welsh

cake the haggis the whiskey the Chelsea

bun the par mo the Cumberland sausage

the Yorkshire pudding or the Cornish

pasty

the UK remains a member of NATO United

Nations and the World Trade Organization

and uses the pound currency in 2016 a

referendum resulted in 51.9% of voters

in favor to leave the European Union

although the countries within the United

Kingdom became divided on the matter

future unity thank you for watching
